title: "Docs: Principles - ControlMe"

## Introduction
One liner:
> “Quick and interactive rating”

Process should takes a few seconds and the user receives a reward for the response.
The current features and customization of campaings also allows for control, quick and interactive survey / feedback, gathering contacts for marketing

We are based on these principles:

> ### 1) simplicity
> ### 2) speed
> ### 3) interactivity
> ### 4) motivation for reaction

Segments:
From small companies to huge franchises such as gastronomy, retail stores, accommodation, social events, manufacturing companies (for test products and get feedback), public events etc.

Calculation:
Monthly rent. The price calculation is not fixed. Calculation based on the number of campaigns, the
of customers (visiting branches, buying the product, etc.).

## Campaigns
One company can create many campaigns. For example, they may create a campaign for branches, especially for its own products, short internal employee survey, etc. That is why we allow them to create campaigns using the partner interface:
- folder creation function
- choose from a templates of campaigns

Campaign content:
- section (title, supplementary question and options)
- maximum of four or five sections

Campaign duration:
1) one, two or three months  
   _Example: discount on coffee from permanent menu_
2) choose specific date in the calendar
   _Example: limited June coffee edition only until the end of the month of June_
   _Second example: Bolt gave us only vouchers that are valid until a certain date_

Both of these types of settings are based on business logic, because some only want to set a promo action for a certain period of time, others may set ever-recurring (fix) reward. According to research, 45-60 days is ideal for campaign duration, because consumers will remember and recall the information in 45-60 days, but not more than that.

### Campaign rewards
A campaign has one or many rewards. The user can choose a reward based on a set of rules set up in the campaign.

### Additional considerations
1) Response frequency limitation:
- only once
- daily
- weekly
2) limitation of the frequency of receiving the reward:
- only once
- daily
- weekly
- unlimited: the user receives a reward at each completion of the campaign

## Summary

This is the same as the questionnaire tools, here is an example of a tool that is very similar and has a nice interface: https://paperform.co
In summary: the user interface (templates, folders) can be practically the same as Paperform.

We will have three types of approaches:
- SUPER ADMIN (my) 
- ADMIN ("DIRECTOR" etc.) 
- SUBADMIN ("manager" etc.)

Two types of campaigns:
- campaigns (classic campaigns), own url and QR, without SUBADMIN
- campaigns with items (practically sub-campaigns), the same url and QR code, each campaign has its own content, with SUBADMIN settings for each campaign (one item = one campaign with SUBADMIN access)
