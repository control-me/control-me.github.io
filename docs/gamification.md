# Gamification

_Definition_: Gamification is simplifying the process of getting users to do something, and to reward them for doing it. It adds fun and engaging game mechanics into real-world or productive activities with the goal of creating a more interesting experience.

Our use case: A gamified rating app with visually appealing interactions, animations and clear design. Ideally, no explanation is needed to understand how to use the app. (see below in detail)

## Principles
We want to make sure that the gamification system is easy to use, and easy to understand. No need to dissociate users from the gamification system, and no need to make users jump through hoops to get a reward.
Therefore, each action should be as simple as possible, and should be as self-explanatory as possible.
- Use clever animations (e.g. animated icons) to suggest actions.
- Use transition animations for state changes so that users don't get confused.
- Use a consistent color scheme, naming scheme, and icon set.
- Use interactive components (e.g. buttons, sliders, carousels) to get users to perform actions.
- Remove unnecessary distracting components (e.g. ads, popups, etc.)
- Reward users for submiting forms, and for completing tasks.

## Gamification rewards
In the context of gamification, rewards are just a way to get users to do something, which means it's a very generic term. Examples:
- A reward set in the campaign, provided by the company who created the campaign.
- A reward provided by us, e.g. referral program.
- Confetti animation when the form has been submitted sucessfully.
- Game mechanics, e.g. points, achievments, levels, badges, leaderboard, etc.

## Psychology of gamification
The most important part of gamification is the reward. Gamification rewards are not only a way to get users to do something, but also a way to get users to do something in a way that is more fun and engaging. Behavioural design places the most emphasis on human motivation in the process. In essence, it is Human-Focused Design (as opposed to “function-focused design”). Games are made to be fun, and entertaing, and should be designed to make users want to play. Interactivity comes in many forms, from simple animations to complex games.
The terms that we use to describe gamification are often used interchangeably, so here are some examples:
- Experience Design: (UX Design) make it usable and accessible by the user.
- Interaction Design: make it interactive, respond to user input, and make it feel natural.
- Behavioural Design: Emphasizing the user's motivation in the process of creating a product.
- Digital Psychology: The use of digital media to increase the user's engagement

# Use case
Rating is a good use case for gamification, only because it is a very common task. First, we need to define the task. In this case, we want users to rate a product or service. There is more than one question, but they can easily fill out the form without much trouble. Ideal form will take less than a minute to fill out.
Attentive users will fill out the form faster, and will be more likely to complete the task. The reward is the product or service that the user rated.
