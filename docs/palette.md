# Palette

A color palette is a set of colors that are used to represent a specific range of values.
The method described below is a way to generate a palette from a set of colors by changing the luminosity of the source color.

## Palette generation and usage

A color palette can be generated from a given input color. 
The color picker generates a palette for any color input. Hue, chroma, and lightness are adjusted by an algorithm that creates palettes that are usable and aesthetically pleasing. The shades include lighter and darker options to separate surfaces and provide colors that meet accessibility standards. 

### Usage
```ts
import { generate } from "$lib/palette";
type ColorShade = {
  color: ColorRGB;
  shade: 50|100|200|300|400|500|600|700|800|900;
}
const shades: ColorShade[] = generate(color);
```

## Text legibility, color contrast, and accessibility
The color palette is generated by reducing the lightness of the color. This is done by calculating the lightness of the source color and then adjusting the hue, chroma, and lightness to produce the resulting color palette with shades ranging from 50 to 900.
Contrast is calculated by calculating the difference between the lightness of the text color and the lightness of the background color.
Text legibility is maintained with a sufficient contrast ratio of the text color and the background color. WCAG 2.0 AA is used to calculate the contrast ratio, which is 4.5:1 for small text and 3.0:1 for large text.
